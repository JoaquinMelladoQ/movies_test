# Movies CCU

This project interfaces with a Star Wars film API, fetching a comprehensive list of films and storing them within a Zustand store for efficient state management. Each film is represented as a visually appealing card that displays key information, offering users a snapshot of the film's details directly from the main screen.

Upon selecting a film card, users are navigated to a detailed screen which provides an in-depth look at the film's characters and planets. This detail view enriches the user experience by presenting a more detailed exploration of the Star Wars universe, right down to the intriguing characters and diverse planets featured in each film.

Built with React Native and leveraging the power of Zustand for state management, the application offers a seamless and engaging way to browse through the iconic Star Wars filmography, making it a must-have for fans and enthusiasts eager to dive into the details of their favorite saga.

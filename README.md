# Movies CCU

This app taps into a Star Wars movie API, pulling all the movie info and keeping it neat in a Zustand store for easy access. Every movie pops up as a cool card showing the important bits, so you get the gist right from the start.

Click on a movie, and boom—you're taken to a page loaded with details on characters and planets. It's a deep dive into the Star Wars world, from its unique characters to the vast planets in each movie.
